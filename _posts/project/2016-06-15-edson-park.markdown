I joined the HOA board of my community, Edson Park, last year to help improve communications. The first step was to add a simple static website that communicated basic information about Edson Park. _Click below to see the finished product!_

This was my first time creating a website for a professional purpose, and I learned a lot from the process. I wanted to write about some of my lessons learned

Sketch first
==============

Sketching on paper is quick and easy. If you invest time to build a digital mock up, it should only be after an initial prototype was agreed upon with the customer. It takes significantly more work to craft something on a computer. Additionally, the increased time investment can make it harder to throw away a bad design. It can even make the bad design convincingly "good". Conversely, a paper sketch takes just a few minutes and no feelings are hurt when it doesn't work out.

Get some content to build with
================================

The lines for content generation were blurred since I live in Edson Park (so I know all about it) and because I was also on the board. However, in the end I realized that the content really needed to come from the other board members and some volutneer neighbors so we could add perspective to the website.

Additionally, I asked for content late in the process. This left me having to alter the design to fit the content better. It would be an improvement to ask for content early and incorporate it in to the design from the start.

How do you vertically align this darn thing?
=============================================

CSS layout can be challenging with poor planning. There are many ways to properly align content, and you have to choose the right way for your scenario. Moreover, in the age of mobile, you better choose a way to properly align your content responsively or you will find yourself doing it again.

The simplest way to layout your content is to use a framework like Bootstrap, or a simple grid system. There are plenty of frameworks available, but I took this opportunity to learn layout the hardway. From scratch.

After hours of struggling to align a div horizontally and vertically, I came out having a much better understanding of how CSS works. The main lesson I learned was that **cascaded properties affect the overall layout**. In the future, I plan to use a simple framework or build my own grid system that can be reused across projects. There is a lot of redundancy/boilerplate in layout that need not be redone.

Also, always remember to test! Test on different browsers, different devices, and different size windows. It's a handful!

Challenging, but rewarding
===========================
All in all, it took me a few weeks to build the website. I iterated a few times and stumbled more than that. It was pull-your-hair-out frustrating at times, but the end result was rewarding and appealing. #wouldbuyagain
