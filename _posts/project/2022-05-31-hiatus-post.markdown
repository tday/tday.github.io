I had a big plans when I first started this blog, but the best laid plan...yada yada yada :).

It turns out life had bigger plans for me! I ended up:
- Moving to Boston to work at Barkly
- Long distance relationship that turned into a loving marriage
- Barkly shutdown after near acquisition
- Joined Embark as a tech lead 

It's been a whirlwind of life since I enjoyed Embark! The biggest change being that I'm now a dad of two under two in an older home that also needs some TLC. I can't overstate how all consuming that is outside of work haha.

That said..I'm going to try to get back into these projects by laying a stake that I'll do one new post a quarter. 

Here's to the next set of plans... :)
